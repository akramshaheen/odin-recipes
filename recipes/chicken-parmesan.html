    <h3>New & Improved Chicken Parmesan</h3>
    <p>
      I love chicken parm, especially when it's made with fresh mozzarella,
      which it almost never is in restaurants. Of course, at home we can use the
      real stuff, but it can be pricey. So I tried something new--a cheese
      spread using ricotta fortified with sharp Cheddar.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 large skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
      <br />
      <li>½ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
      <br />
      <li>1 pinch ground black pepper</li>
      <br />
      <li>½ cup flour</li>
      <br />
      <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
      <br />
      <li>¾ cup dry bread crumbs</li>
      <br />
      <li>½ cup light olive oil for frying, or as needed</li>
      <br />
      <li>½ cup ricotta cheese</li>
      <br />
      <li>½ cup shredded sharp white Cheddar cheese</li>
      <br />
      <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
      <br />
      <li>½ teaspoon olive oil</li>
      <br />
      <li>2 tablespoons grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese for topping</li>
      <br />
      <li>1 cup marinara sauce, heated, or more as needed</li>
      <br />
      <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley</li>
      <br />
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps To Follow</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C). Line a rimmed baking
        sheet with aluminum foil.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Gently pound chicken breasts between 2 layers of plastic until each
        breast is evenly thick. Place breasts on a plate and season 1 side with
        kosher salt and black pepper. Sprinkle with flour; press flour to coat
        the entire surface and help it adhere. Turn and repeat on second side
        with salt, pepper, and flour.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Brush excess flour from plate; place the chicken breasts back on the
        plate. Pour beaten egg over the breasts and coat each side. Cover bottom
        of a second plate with half the bread crumbs. Transfer chicken to the
        bread crumbs. Push crumbs up sides of chicken. Sprinkle on the remaining
        crumbs and thoroughly coat each side.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Heat 1/2 inch olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook chicken
        until crispy and golden, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer to prepared
        baking sheet.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Mix ricotta and Cheddar cheese together in a bowl. Stir in salt, black
        pepper, cayenne, and olive oil. Spread half the cheese mixture on each
        breast without extending all the way to the edges. Dust with
        Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese and drizzle with olive oil.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Bake on center rack of preheated oven until cheese is melted and chicken
        is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 10 to 12
        minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should
        read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        To serve, ladle the heated marinara sauce in a wide circle on warm
        plates. Place chicken in center and sprinkle with chopped parsley.
      </li>
    </ol>
