    <h3>Budget-Friendly Crab Salad</h3>
    <p>
      I came up with this crab salad recipe after trying for years to duplicate
      one made at a seafood market where I used to work. This isn't the same,
      but I actually like it better. It's so easy to make — the most
      time-consuming part is separating the crab meat. When I make it, my
      daughter takes the whole batch and hides so she can eat it all. Serve with
      club-style crackers.
